	                    I’m Gabe, a U.S., French, and German game developer and recent graduate from Boise State University, 
                        where I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile Technologies (GIMM). I’ve lived in France, the U.S., and recently 
                        moved to  Germany, which has shaped my collaborative approach and adaptability when working with diverse teams. 
                        I focus on game development and interactive storytelling - crafting experiences that combine creativity, empathy, and technology. 
                        I’ve always been fascinated by how games can do more than just entertain: they can teach, heal, and connect people in meaningful ways. 
                        Over the past few years, I’ve developed several small games and projects through both coursework and personal work. 
                        In my free time, I also enjoy role-playing games like D&D and card games like   Magic: The Gathering, which fuel my passion for storytelling, 
                        strategy, and creative problem-solving and continue to inspire the worlds and systems I build in my own projects.

                        Throughout my studies, I’ve worked on multiple projects, from web development to short games. Many of these were completed as part of my degree, 
                        but I also produced some of these in my personal time. These projects made use of C#, CSS, HTML, Maya, Unity, and more.

                        This <a href ="BookWebsite.zip">website</a>, which I developed in 2023, was designed to house and display data regarding the books I had read in that year. 
                        I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the website and display the data. I am particularly proud of my use of JavaScript and React.

                        I designed <a href = "DisplacementGameBuildFile.zip"> this game</a> in 2023, as an entry into the GMTK 2023 Game Jam; while I ultimately did not submit it to the competition, 
                        I want to share it here as an example of some of my earliest independent work.

                        I designed this <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YKdNlfYyKmXlold8XsMBhim8P_ZgHlX8/view?usp=sharing" target ="_blank">VR game</a> fully from scratch, as part of my degree. Everything, from the code, to the assets, to the sound effects, was created independently. 
                        The game functions as a simulation of a morning routine, and is intended to help people who may struggle with forming habits, such as people with 
                        learning disabilities.
