	    My name is Gabriel De Cock, I am a 23 year old graduate from Boise State University with a Bachelors of Science in Games, Interactive Media and Mobile T    echnologies (GIMM), 
        specialising in Game Design and Development. I have been passionate about games, both digital and physical, for my entire life. I have been playing TTRPGs since 2015 
        and Magic: The Gathering since 2017. I have developed multiple small 5 minute games, both for school and for personal enjoyment.

            As part of my degree, I made a website that compiled the data of all of the books I had read in 2023 and displayed the data.
