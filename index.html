	    My name is Gabriel De Cock, I am a 23 year old graduate from Boise State University with a Bachelors of Science in Games, Interactive Media and Mobile Technologies (GIMM), 
        specialising in Game Design and Development. I have been passionate about games, both digital and physical, for my entire life. I have been playing TTRPGs since 2015 
        and Magic: The Gathering since 2017. I have developed multiple small 5 minute games, both for school and for personal enjoyment.

            These are projects that I have worked on both for school and indepentanly. They vary from web dev to games, using HTML, C#, CSS, Maya, Unity, and more.

            This is a website I made that displays data based on the books that I read in 2023. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the website and display the data.

           In summer of 2023 I attemtped to participate in GMTK 2023, and while I ultimately didn't submit the game I had made I still want to share it here as an example 
           of some of my earliest work.

            As part of my degree I had to create a VR game completely indepentanly, creating everything from the code to the assests to the sound effects myself. I decided to create 
            a VR simulation of a morning routine in order to help people who struggle with routine, such as people with learning disabilities.
