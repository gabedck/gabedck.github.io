	                    Hi there! My name is Gabriel De Cock, and I am a 23 year old fresh graduate from Boise State University. My Bachelor’s degree is in Games, Interactive Media 
                        and Mobile Technologies (GIMM), and during my studies I specialized in Game development and Design, as well as App Development, 3d modeling, and more. 
                        I have been passionate about video games, TTRPGs, and card games for my entire life. In the last 4 years, I’ve developed multiple short games, both 
                        through my degree and in my personal time. I believe that games and interactive media can help people, not just for entertainment 
                        but as tools to make the world a better place.

        <p>
            Throughout my studies, I’ve worked on multiple projects, from web development to short games. Many of these were completed as part of my degree, 
            but I also produced some of these in my personal time. These projects made use of C#, CSS, HTML, Maya, Unity, and more.

                        This website, which I developed in 2023, was designed to house and display data regarding the books I had read in that year. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
                        to create the website and display the data. I am particularly proud of my use of JavaScript and React.

                        I designed this game in 2023, as an entry into the GMTK 2023 Game Jam; while I ultimately did not submit it to the competition, 
                        I want to share it here as an example of some of my earliest independent work.

                        I designed this VR game fully from scratch, as part of my degree. Everything, from the code, to the assets, to the sound effects, was created independently. 
                        The game functions as a simulation of a morning routine, and is intended to help people who may struggle with forming habits, such as people with 
                        learning disabilities.
